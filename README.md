# Spectral-Absorption-in-Fabry-Perot-Nanocavity
Studying Spectral Light Absorption in Fabry Perot nanocavity using MEEP (Open Source Platform for Electromagnetic Simulation using Python IDE) . Used Drude Dispersive model for defining the optical properties of material. Finally used Matplotlib to plot the obtained Absorption curve.

Attached in this repo you can find the following files:
1. fabry perot papertalk: This is a powerpoint report based on my entire project.
2. InSb_0V_100res: This is my absorption and reflectivity plot against wavelength (visible region)
3. InSb_permittivity: Complex permittivity vs wavelength plot for InSb using Drude Dispersive model
4. main script.py: the meep script(python) i used for my simulatiion
5. InSb_permittvity.py: script i used to compute the permittivity of InSb in the visible region as per drude dispersive model.
