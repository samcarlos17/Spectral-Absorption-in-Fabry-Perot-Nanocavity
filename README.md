# Spectral-Absorption-in-Fabry-Perot-Nanocavity
Studying Spectral Light Absorption in Fabry Perot nanocavity using MEEP (Open Source Platform for Electromagnetic Simulation using Python IDE) . Used Drude Dispersive model for defining the optical properties of material. Finally used Matplotlib to plot the obtained Absorption curve.
